# Setting up my first blog post with Jekyll

## Why setting up a blog?

 

With the fast evolving pace of technology I found it usefull to write a blog about my learnings as I develop projects. My main goal with these writtings will be to solidify my knowledge in the different areas I apply to each project. ![Desktop View](/assets/images/coding.jpg){: w="325" h="190" .right }

I predict that most of my writings will be on the topic of coding, but not exclusive to that. Hope others can take advantage of my blogging and feel free to use any resources posted on this website. 

Lastly, I had a strong encouragement to start this project from Viktor Lovgren, a fellow coder who has his own blog with great writings and where I take large inspiration from, visit his own blog website, you wont regret it: [Viktor Lovgren blog](https://www.viktorlovgren.com/)

## What's Jekyll and how to set it up?

_Please note that eventhough you don't need to be a cyberphunk hacker with 100+ years of dev experience, it is however recomended that you know some basics such as how to use your command line and basic HTML and CSS syntax._  

As stated in their page, [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static website generator, perfect for blogs. Built in Ruby, it uses markdown syntax, which creates an easy and acessible experience for writers. The best part? It is really easy to setup and even better, you have hundreds of already existing themes that you can use from the get go. Actually this same site you are on is an existing theme called [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page/).

To get started on Jekyll all you need to do is follow the instructions in this [link](https://jekyllrb.com/tutorials/convert-site-to-jekyll/). I won't be doind a step by step guide as that would be basically a copy paste from their documentation, but I can tell you in advance that you will be installing Ruby and Node.js in your maching.

**Now how do you set your site using an existing theme?** 

First, go this [github link](https://github.com/topics/jekyll-theme) which has an extensive list of various jekyll themes and pick one that suits your taste. From there follow their instructions. In my case I used Chirpy theme and I was lucky enough to have a dedicated tutorial page just for the setup which you can find [here](https://chirpy.cotes.page/posts/getting-started/). 

Depending on how you do your setup, you can start writing straight away and create your blog with minimal coding requirements.

_Note to self - Start the server with:_

    $bundle exec jekyll s

Hope this helps!
